			<h4>Reflexology is a safe, complementary, and beneficial therapy where appropriate amounts of pressure are applied to pressure points in specific areas of the body.<br><br>
 
			In Reflexology, it is understood that certain pressure, or trigger, points correspond to specific body and organ systems. Through precise manipulation of these trigger points, an individual will experience improvements overall in his or her general health, or more specifically, healthier organ and gland functions. <br><br>
